Hard Disk Drive
❑A Hard Disk Drive (HDD) is a non-volatile data storage device
commonly found in computers, laptops, servers, and many
electronic devices.
❑It uses magnetic storage to store and retrieve digital
information by spinning multiple rigid disks (platters)
coated with magnetic material.

HDD Key Characteristics
❑Function: Stores operating systems, applications, documents, media files,
and virtually all user and system data.
❑Structure: Contains spinning platters, read/write heads, actuator arm,
controller electronics, and is housed in a protective casing.
❑Working Principle: Data is encoded as tiny magnetized zones on the
platters. As platters spin, read/write heads move very close to the surface
to read or change the magnetization, representing binary data (0s and 1s).
❑Capacity: Modern HDDs range from hundreds of gigabytes (GB) to
multiple terabytes (TB)

HDD – Simple Working
❑ The platters spin at high speed (5400–15000 RPM).
❑ Read/write heads attached to arms quickly move to locate the
right place on the platter.
❑ The controller board manages all operations and communicates
with the computer via a connector (SATA, IDE, SCSI, etc.).
❑ Data stays intact even when the device is powered off (non-volatile).

HDD – Components
❑Platters
❑ Flat, circular disks (usually made of aluminum or glass, coated
with magnetic material) where data is actually stored.
❑ A standard HDD contains multiple platters stacked vertically;
each surface can store data.
❑Spindle
❑ The rotating axis/wheel holding the platters in place.
❑ Spins the platters at high speeds (typically 5400, 7200, or
10,000+ RPM), enabling rapid data access.

HDD – Components
❑Read/Write Arm (Actuator Arm)
❑ A thin, pivoting metallic arm that moves across the platters.
❑ Positions the read/write head over the correct track on the
platter for reading or writing data.
❑Actuator (Voice Coil Motor)
❑ The device (often an electromagnet) that controls the precise
movement of the read/write arm.
❑ Allows rapid, accurate movement to the required data location.
02-11-2025 7
Module 6 - Virtualization
HDD – Components
❑ Read/Write Head
❑ Microscopic electromagnetic devices located at the tip of each actuator
arm.
❑ Flies just above the platter surface, reading or altering the magnetic
fields to store/retrieve bits.
❑ Each platter surface has its own dedicated head.
❑Controller Board (PCB)
❑ The electronic circuit board mounted on the underside of the drive.
❑ Manages all internal communication, power regulation, and data
transfer between the HDD and host (computer).

Disk Scheduling Algorithm
❑A disk scheduling algorithm is a strategy used by operating
systems to decide the order in which disk I/O (input/output)
requests are serviced.
❑ These algorithms are vital in multi-tasking systems or
environments with heavy disk usage, because multiple
read/write requests may arrive simultaneously or out of
sequence.
02-11-2025 11
Module 6 - Virtualization
Disk Scheduling Algorithm – Why important
❑ Minimizes overall waiting time for disk accesses.
❑ Reduces mechanical movement of the disk’s read/write heads,
decreasing seek time and improving performance.
❑ Prevents starvation and ensures fairness among requests.
02-11-2025 12
Module 6 - Virtualization
Disk Scheduling Algorithm – Goals
❑ Optimize:
❑ Seek time (time to move disk head between tracks)
❑ Rotational latency (time for required sector to rotate under
head)
❑ Throughput (number of serviced requests per time unit)
❑ Fairness (avoid neglecting distant requests)
02-11-2025 13
Module 6 - Virtualization
Disk Scheduling Algorithm – Metrics
❑Seek Time
❑ The time taken for the disk’s read/write head to move
from its current position to the track containing the
desired data.
❑Example
❑ Suppose the head is at track 20 and your data is at track
80. If each track jump takes 0.5 ms, total seek time = 60
tracks × 0.5 ms = 30 ms.
02-11-2025 14
Module 6 - Virtualization
Disk Scheduling Algorithm – Metrics
❑Rotational Latency
❑The time it takes for the desired disk sector to rotate under
the read/write head after the head has reached the correct
track. It depends on disk rotation speed.
❑Example:
❑ A disk spins at 7200 RPM (Revolutions Per Minute). One full
rotation takes 60sec/7200 = 0.0083sec = 8.3ms
❑ The average rotational latency is half of this: 4.15 ms.
02-11-2025 15
Module 6 - Virtualization
Disk Scheduling Algorithm – Metrics
❑Transfer Time
❑ The time required to actually transfer (read/write) the data
once the head is positioned correctly.
❑Example:
If the disk can transfer data at 100 MB/s and you want to read
MB
1
1 MB, Transfer Time = = 0.01 sec = 10 ms.
MB/s

Disk Scheduling Algorithm – Metrics
❑Throughput
❑ The number of disk requests serviced in a given period
(requests per second).
❑Example:
❑If 70 I/O requests are completed in 10 seconds,
70
Throughput = = 7 requests/sec.

Disk Scheduling Algorithm – Metrics
❑Fairness
❑ The extent to which requests—whether near or far from the
current head position—are serviced without undue delay or
starvation.
❑Example:
❑ SSTF may be fast for short seeks, but is less fair (may starve
far requests), while SCAN and C-SCAN offer balanced
fairness.

Algorithm Definition
FCFS (First-Come, First- Requests are processed in the exact order they arrive. Simple and fair, but not
Served) always efficient.
SSTF (Shortest Seek Time The request closest to the current position of the disk arm is handled first, which
First) minimizes immediate head movement.
The disk arm moves in one direction, servicing all requests along its path. When it
SCAN (Elevator)
reaches the end, it reverses and services requests on the way back, like an elevator.
The disk arm moves in one direction, servicing requests until it reaches the end.
C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)
Then, it quickly returns to the start (without servicing on the way back) and repeats.
The disk arm moves only as far as the last request in each direction, then reverses,
LOOK
instead of going all the way to the physical end of the disk.
The arm goes from the current position to the furthest request in one direction, then
C-LOOK jumps to the furthest request in the other direction and continues, skipping over
empty parts of the disk.

Disk Scheduling Algorithm
❑Suppose the head of moving disk with 200 tracks, numbered 0
to 199 is currently serving a request at track 132 and has just
finished a request at track 120.
❑ If the queue of requests is kept in the FIFO order 38, 55, 86,
123, 147, 91, 177, 115, 94, 150, 100, 175 and 130, 185.
❑What is total head movement to satisfy these request for the all-
disk scheduling algorithms?
