Q1. Processes P1, P2, P3 and P4 arrive in that order at times 0, 1, 2, and 8 milliseconds
respectively, and have execution times of 10, 13, 6, and 9 milliseconds respectively. Shortest
Remaining Time First (SRTF) algorithm is used as the CPU scheduling policy. Ignore context
switching times. Calculate the average turnaround time, Average Waiting time and Average
Response time for four processes in milliseconds?
Q2. A computer has two processors, M1 and M2. Four processes P1, P2, P3, P4 with CPU bursts
of 20, 16, 25, and 10 milliseconds, respectively, arrive at the same time and these are the only
processes in the system. The scheduler uses non-pre-emptive priority scheduling, with priorities
decided as follows:
▪ M1 uses priority of execution for the processes as, P1>P3>P2>P4, i.e., P1 and P4 have
highest and lowest priorities, respectively.
▪ M2 uses priority of execution for the processes as, P2>P3>P4>P1,i.e., P2 and P1 have
highest and lowest priorities, respectively.
A process Pi is scheduled to a processor Mk, if the processor is free and no other process Pj is
waiting with higher priority. At any given point of time, a process can be allocated to any one of
the free processors without violating the execution priority rules. Ignore the context switch time.
What will be the average waiting time of the processes in milliseconds?
Q3. You are an operating systems designer tasked with analyzing the performance of two different
CPU scheduling algorithms for a new system. You have been given a set of five processes with
their arrival times and required CPU burst times.
Process Details:
Process Arrival Time (ms) CPU Burst Time (ms) Priority
P1 0 12 3
P2 2 7 1
P3 3 5 2
P4 6 8 4
P5 8 4 1
Task:
Analyse the performance of the following two scheduling algorithms for the set of processes
described above.
Q4. Four processes (P1, P2, P3, P4) arrive at time t=0 with the characteristics shown below. Their
total CPU burst time is the sum of their Data Processing Time and Computational Time
Process Data Processing Computational Ops Ops per ms Priority
Size Rate (KB/ms) (millions) (millions/ms)
(KB)
P1 120 10 30 5 2
P2 90 15 24 8 1
P3 100 10 25 5 3
P4 80 20 12 6 1
Scheduling Rule:
The system uses a non-preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF) algorithm. If a tie occurs for the
shortest burst time, the tie is resolved by using pre-emptive Priority scheduling (a lower
number means higher priority) only among the tied processes. Calculate the average turnaround
time and average waiting time for these processes. Assume context switching time is negligible.
