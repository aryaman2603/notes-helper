System Threats and Security
❑Operating System (OS) security refers to the measures taken to
protect a computer system's resources—such as the CPU,
memory, disks, and data—from unauthorized access,
malicious attacks, and interference
❑ Security systems aim to ensure confidentiality, integrity,
and availability of system resources against external threats.

System Threats and Security
❑ System Threats
❑ A system threat is any program or event that has the
potential to cause damage to a computer system.
❑ These threats can be intentional or accidental and are
typically launched by non-users or unauthorized programs
from outside the operating system.

System Threats and Security
❑A virus is a self-replicating piece of code that attaches itself to legitimate programs. When
the host program is executed, the virus also runs, potentially corrupting or destroying
files and spreading to other programs.
❑A Trojan horse is a malicious program disguised as useful software. It performs a hidden,
destructive function while appearing to do something benign. Unlike viruses, Trojans do
not replicate themselves.
❑Trap Door (or Backdoor) is a secret entry point into a program that allows someone to
gain access while bypassing normal security measures. It may be left by the original
developer for testing or intentionally placed for malicious purposes

System Threats and Security
❑Logic Bomb This is a piece of code intentionally inserted into a software system that will
trigger a malicious function when specified conditions are met. The trigger could be a
specific date, time, or the absence of a particular file
❑Buffer Overflow This occurs when a program attempts to write more data into a fixed-
length memory block (a buffer) than it can hold. The excess data overwrites adjacent
memory, which can corrupt data, crash the program, or, in a targeted attack, execute
malicious code with the privileges of the compromised application.
❑Privilege Escalation This attack involves a user with limited permissions exploiting a
vulnerability to gain elevated access (e.g., administrator or root privileges).

Policy vs. Mechanism
❑ In the context of OS security, policy and mechanism are
distinct concepts that work together to enforce security rules
Policy Mechanism
A security policy defines what needs to be A security mechanism is the implementation or
secured. It is a set of high-level rules and tool used to enforce a policy. It provides the
objectives that specify the desired security how—the specific methods, functions, and
goals for a system. Policies are about the goals, hardware used to achieve the security goals

Access vs. Authentication
❑ Authentication and access (via authorization) are sequential steps in a secure process. Authentication
confirms identity, while access control determines what an identified user can do.
Authentication Authorization ( Governs Access)

❑Access Control is the practical application of authorization. Once a user is authenticated and their
authorization level is determined, the access control mechanism enforces this policy, either granting or
denying the user's request to access a resource.

Module 7 – System Protection
System Protection
❑System protection is concerned with controlling access to resources
within a computer system.
❑ The goal is to ensure that processes, users, and programs can only
access the objects (like files, devices, or memory segments) for which
they have been granted authorization, and only in the manner
specified.
❑Two fundamental models for this are the
❑Access Matrix and
❑Capability-Based Systems.

System Protection : Access Matrix
❑ An Access Matrix is a conceptual model used to define the access rights of
subjects to objects.
❑Subjects: These are the active entities that request access, such as users or
processes. The rows of the matrix represent subjects (often grouped into
domains of execution).
❑Objects: These are the passive resources that need protection, such as files,
printers, or other devices. The columns of the matrix represent objects.
❑Access Rights: The cells of the matrix, Access(i, j), contain the set of
operations that a subject in domain i can perform on object j. Examples of
rights include read, write, execute, and own.

System Protection : Access Matrix
❑Imagine a small company with three users (acting as subjects) and four
resources (objects):
❑Subjects/Domains:
❑D1: Alice (a project manager)
❑D2: Bob (a finance analyst)
❑D3: Charlie (a developer)
❑Objects:
❑File1: Project_Plan.docx
❑File2: Financials.xlsx
❑File3: Source_Code.c
❑Object1: Printer
06-11-2025 10
Module 6 - Virtualization
System Protection : Access Matrix
❑The security policy can be represented by the following Access Matrix:
Domain / Object File1 (Project Plan) File2 (Financials) File3 (Source Code) Object1 (Printer)
D1: Alice read,write read print
D2: Bob read read,write print
D3: Charlie read read,write
❑ The Access Matrix itself is an abstract model. In a real OS, it is too large
and sparse to be stored as a simple table. Instead, it is implemented in one
of two primary ways: Access Control Lists or Capability Lists
06-11-2025 11
Module 6 - Virtualization
System Protection : Access Matrix
❑ Access Control Lists (ACLs) - A Column-based View: The matrix is
broken down by columns (objects). Each object has a list (an ACL)
attached to it that specifies which subjects have what rights.
❑Example: The Financials.xlsx file would have an ACL like this:
(D1:Alice, {read}), (D2:Bob, {read, write}).
❑When Alice tries to write to the file, the system checks this list, sees she
only has read permission, and denies the operation.
06-11-2025 12
Module 6 - Virtualization
System Protection : Capability Lists
❑Capability Lists - A Row-based View: The matrix is broken down by rows
(subjects).
❑ Each subject has a list of "capabilities," where each capability specifies an
object and the access rights for it. This forms the basis for capability-based
systems.
❑Example: Alice would possess a capability list:
(File1, {read, write}), (File2, {read}), (Object1, {print}).

Module 6 - Virtualization
Capability-Based Systems
❑A capability-based system takes the concept of a capability list and makes it the
central security mechanism. In this model, a capability is like a key that gives
the holder specific rights to an object.
❑ A capability is a data structure that contains two key pieces of information:
❑ A unique pointer or identifier to an object.
❑ The set of access rights for that object (e.g., read, write).
❑The operating system kernel ensures that capabilities cannot be forged or
modified by user-level processes. The core principle is: possession of a capability
is proof of the right to access the object.
